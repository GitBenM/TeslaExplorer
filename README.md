# TeslaExplorer
The TeslaExplorer is a fun way for me to learn new things and present information about my Tesla vehicle in a manner I find pleasing.

The app has the following features:
* login
* view account vehicles
* start and stop charging
* set the charge limit

Shout out to the [tesla-api](https://github.com/timdorr/tesla-api) project for documenting the endpoints.
