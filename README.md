# TeslaExplorer
A fun side project to make use of the unofficial Tesla API.
This app has some basic features, such as login/logout, viewing vehicles associated with your account, starting and stopping charging, and setting the charge limit.
Big thanks to the tesla-api project https://github.com/timdorr/tesla-api
