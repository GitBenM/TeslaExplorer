# TeslaExplorer
A fun side project to make use of the unofficial Tesla API.

The app has some basic features:
* login/logout
* view vehicles associated with your account
* start and stop charging
* set the charge limit

Big thanks to the [tesla-api](https://github.com/timdorr/tesla-api) project for documenting the endpoints.
