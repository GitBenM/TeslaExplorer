# TeslaExplorer
[TeslaExplorer](http://teslaexplorer.azurewebsites.net/) is a fun way for me to learn new things and present information about my Tesla vehicle in a manner I find pleasing.

The app has the following features:
* login
* view account vehicles
* start and stop charging
* set the charge limit

Features I want to add:
* Better wake up management
* Smart HVAC scheduling
  * Turn on HVAC to condition the cabin on a schedule instead of doing it manually
* Smart charging schedule
  * Start charging based on the state of charge, rate of charge sampled (user defined sampling time) and state of charge limit
  * Avoids the situation where you're scheduled charge start doesn't provide enough time to recoup the previous days driving


Shout out to the [tesla-api](https://github.com/timdorr/tesla-api) project for documenting the endpoints.
